The "Projects" section showcases some of the projects I've been working on. Here are a few of the projects you'll find:

1. **Fake YouTube**: This project is a YouTube-like webpage with a header containing a logo, search bar, and various navigation icons. The main content area displays a grid of video previews with video titles, channel names, and view counts. Users can interact with the search bar, navigation links, and video previews to explore and watch videos.
